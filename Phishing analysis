🚨 Phishing Email Analysis Report
📧 Subject: "Your account is in danger"
1️⃣ Examine Sender’s Email Address
Shown Address: no-reply.accounts.google@wpereview.org

🔍 Red Flags:

Legitimate Google emails come from domains like @google.com, not @wpereview.org.

This domain appears unrelated and suspicious — classic email spoofing tactic.

2️⃣ Check Email Headers for Discrepancies

🛠️ Suggested Tool: Use an email header analyzer to review:

SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation

Actual sending server's IP

Return-path mismatches

3️⃣ Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments
🔗 Suspicious Button: Install Google Defender

⚠️ Concerns:

This “Google Defender” does not exist — it's a fake application.

The button likely redirects to a malicious or phishing site.

4️⃣ Look for Urgent or Threatening Language
🗣️ Message says: “Your account is in danger” and urges immediate action.

😨 Intent: To scare the user into clicking without thinking — fear-based phishing.

5️⃣ Check for Mismatched URLs
👀 Required Action: Hover over the “Install Google Defender” button.

❌ If the link does not lead to a Google domain, it's likely a phishing trap.

6️⃣ Verify Grammar & Spelling
🔍 Observation:

Wording is overly simplistic.

Odd phrase: “Best, The Mail Team” — Google does not use this sign-off.

The footer: “2016 Mail Corp.” is fake and doesn't exist.
