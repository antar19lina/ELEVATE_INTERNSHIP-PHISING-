# üìß Phishing Email Analysis Toolkit üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This repository contains resources, methods, and a mini-guide to **analyze and detect phishing emails**. It is intended for cybersecurity learners, analysts, and bug bounty hunters who want to understand and document phishing indicators effectively.

## üîç Objectives

- Analyze phishing emails step-by-step.
- Detect red flags such as spoofed senders, malicious links, and suspicious content.
- Document phishing indicators in a structured format.

## üõ†Ô∏è Analysis Steps

Below is a structured approach used in this project for phishing email investigation:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Obtain a Sample Email**
Use publicly available phishing emails or real-world samples for testing purposes (never engage with live malicious emails from unknown sources).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Examine Sender's Email Address**
- Check for spoofed domains or slight misspellings (e.g., `admin@micros0ft.com`).
- Look for public domain usage instead of official domains.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyze Email Headers**
- Use tools like [MXToolbox Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) or [Google Admin Toolbox](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/) to detect:
  - SPF/DKIM failures
  - IP mismatches
  - Unusual sending paths

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Check Links and Attachments**
- Hover over links without clicking to view their actual destination.
- Check for mismatched display vs. actual URLs.
- Look for unsolicited or password-protected attachments.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Look for Urgent or Threatening Language**
Phishing often uses emotional triggers:
- "Your account will be suspended!"
- "Immediate action required!"

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Check for Mismatched URLs**
- Displayed URLs like `www.paypal.com` may redirect to something like `phishingsite.ru/login`.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Spelling and Grammar Errors**
- Professional services rarely have grammatical mistakes.
- Poor formatting, random capitalization, or broken language are red flags.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Summarize Traits Found**
Create a final report summarizing:
- What traits indicate phishing
- Why the email is suspicious
- What the intended action from the attacker was
