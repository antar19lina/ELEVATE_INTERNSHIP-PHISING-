🕵️‍♂️ Phishing Email Analysis Report
📩 Subject: "has a document for your review"
1️⃣ Examine Sender’s Email Address
Sender: goog...@protected-download.com

🚩 Red Flag:

The domain protected-download.com is not associated with Google.

This is a spoofed address, made to look like a Google service.

2️⃣ Check Email Headers for Discrepancies

🔧 Recommended Tool: MX Toolbox Email Header Analyzer

✅ Check for:

SPF / DKIM / DMARC authentication

Sending server IP

Return-path domain mismatch

3️⃣ Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments
🔗 Highlighted Link: "📄 Click Here"

⚠️ Highly suspicious:

Clicking the link could lead to a malicious phishing site that steals credentials or installs malware.

No clear information on what the PDF is or who it’s from.

4️⃣ Look for Urgent or Vague Language
💬 Message is vague: “has shared the following PDF”

🚨 This lack of context is a known tactic to encourage curiosity-driven clicks.

5️⃣ Check for Mismatched URLs
🧐 Action Needed: Hover over the "Click Here" link to inspect the real URL.

If it doesn’t point to a verified Google domain (e.g., drive.google.com), it’s likely malicious.

6️⃣ Verify Grammar and Branding
📌 Odd phrasing: “has shared the following PDF” without naming the sender

🤔 Uses Google Drive branding and logo without proper formatting or context

✅ Google normally includes:

Sender’s full name

File title

Verified Google domain
